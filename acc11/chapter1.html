            <h2>Introduction to Accounting</h2>
        
            <h3>Accounting</h3>
            <p>• Accounting is the science of efficiently documenting, categorising, and summarising monetary transactions and evaluating the findings efficiently.</p>
        
            <h3>Functions of Accounting</h3>
            <p>• <b>Identifying:</b> The initial stage in accounting is to identify company transactions from multiple sources. It entails keeping track of all company activities and determining the deemed financial transactions.</p>
            <p>• <b>Recording:</b> Only monetary transactions are documented in ledgers. It entails maintaining a precise record of them and recording them in a diary.</p>
            <p>• <b>Classifying:</b> The transactions are categorised after being recorded. The term “classification” refers to all similar transactions in one location.</p>
            <p>• <b>Summarising:</b> Trial balance is the process of bringing all account balances together in one place.</p>
            <p>• <b>Communicating:</b> Accounting also entails communicating financial data such as financial statements to users, such as financial statements, who analyse them according to their needs.</p>
        
            <h3>Accounting’s Objectives</h3>
                <p>• Maintain accurate records of company transactions by established procedures to reduce the risk of omission and fraud.</p>
                <p>• Determine the net profit or loss resulting from the company’s transactions during a specific period and the causes for profit or loss.</p>
                <p>• Accounting information, such as a balance sheet, is used to assess a company’s financial condition.</p>
                <p>• Determine business progress from year to year and detect errors and frauds.</p>
                <p>• Provide accounting information to various interested parties, including owners, creditors, banks, and workers, who conduct in-depth analyses based on the stakeholders’ needs.</p>
        
            <h3>Accounting’s Benefits</h3>
            <p>• Accounting keeps track of all corporate transactions and gives accurate data to stakeholders.</p>
            <p>• Accounting shows a company’s profit and loss over a specific period.</p>
            <p>• Accounting allows for a comparison of many aspects of a firm, such as profit, sales, and purchases, with past years and assists in making decisions.</p>
            <p>• Accounting is used to evaluate and enhance the performance of personnel, divisions, activities, and other entities.</p>
            <p>• Accounting records are accepted as evidence in court proceedings.</p>
        
            <h3>Accounting’s Limitations</h3>
            <p>• Accounting primarily considers monetary transactions, ignoring non-monetary factors such as quality, honesty, and abilities.</p>
            <p>• It solely evaluates previous transactions, and financial statements do not account for changes in price levels.</p>
            <p>• Personal judgments impact it, introducing personal prejudice and lowering its trustworthiness.</p>
            <p>• It is influenced by window dressing, manipulating financial statements to appear more favourable.</p>
            <p>• Financial statements are records of past occurrences and are not suited for predicting.</p>
        
            <h3>Accounting’s Bookkeeping Base</h3>
            <p>• The art of documenting transactions in books of accounts is known as bookkeeping. Only transactions with a monetary value are kept track of. It is the initial stage in the accounting process, with its primary aim being to preserve records or maintain books of accounts.</p>
